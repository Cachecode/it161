                    <h2>Web Accessibility</h2>
                    <p>Accessibility is a topic that should be kept in the forefront of your mind as a web developer. It is far too easy to get carried away, caught up in creative flow, possibly causing one to overlook the importance of creating a website that anyone can use.</p>
                    <p>There are an estimated 60 million people living with disabilities in the United States alone, and the web is world-wide. Developing accessible applications, web pages, or hubs should always be a priority. With accessibility a priority, the remainder of your development can be built on a solid foundation. A successful website must offer accessibility, flexibility, usability, and good design. With these four features your website will naturally be equipped for use now and in the future.</p>
                    <p> It is important to think of the users of websites, the users of the internet, technology, everyone is different. Not everyone uses the web the same, we use different devices, we sometimes need extra tools, for some, technology is not so easy to navigate; it can be very intimidating. To develop an accessible website, it should always be keyboard-friendly, use Default HTML tags, structure content with proper headers, add alt text to your images, display data with tables, design accessible forms, and choose colors carefully. As a developer you should do what you can to help, and always keep these tips in mind, in fact, keep these tips implemented. I believe this is a web developers’ job. Whether it be writing code or styling for the viewer, it should be developed with others in mind. There are guidelines to follow under the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and the first principle is “Perceivable, Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. ” <small>(How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference))</small></p>
                    <p>Making a website keyboard friendly is a must, test this by setting your mouse aside, can you navigate with the tab key? If the answer is no, the website is not accessible. A lot of assistive technology is based on keyboard navigation. There are many assistive tools people may use to navigate technology, keyboard navigation alone is just one, think beyond. Dynamic content changes without reloading the page it is on. Assistive tools are needed so users do not miss out.</p>
                    <p>ARIA, Accessible Rich Internet Applications, was created to improve accessibility through attributes that developers can add with HTML. It is important to know when to use ARIA. When implementing a tabbed interface, there is no semantic function in HTML, but using— role=’tablist’, and related attributes, you can offer details if there is a tabbed interface for the sake of the user. Think of ARIA as a way to ‘fill in the blanks’, where web page information is not available. </p>
                    <p>POSH, Plain Old Semantic Html, it is good to remember to use correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible. There are many reasons why it is important to use correct HTML, but to list a few, it is easier to develop with, it is better on mobile, and it's good for search engines. One of the best aids for a screen reader is having proper text content. Headings, Paragraphs, lists. For example, see figure 1 below.</p>   
                    <p>A screen reader reads headers in the order they come, noting the header, the paragraphs that follow. Screen readers will stop after each element, allowing the chosen pace of the reader. It allows them to jump head, go back, they can also bring up a list of all the headings, like a table of contents. Semantic HTML will not take any longer to write than bad markup if it is done consistently.</p>
                    <p>Headers are vital for a web page because they communicate the organization on the page. There is a ranking system involved, the most important being (&lt;h1&gt;) and least important (&lt;h6&gt;). Skipping heading ranks can lead to confusion and is best to keep your page organized for the ease of better understanding. Every little detail counts.</p>
                    <p>Alt text is important and should be implemented onto your photos for a few reasons. In case your image fails to load. In the case this happens, the Alt tag will display, users would then see what image was intended to be there. It is also important for search engines but most importantly it is for the visually impaired. People who use screen readers will be able to identify and interpret what image is displaying on the screen. Alt text is needed for this. It is important to explain the image for the visually impaired.</p>
                    <p>It is important to know when to use Tables when displaying data. Data makes a lot more sense when it is organized. An HTML table is the most optimal way to do this. Whatever data you may be presenting, offer the user a clear view. Something anyone can understand and make use of.</p>
                    <p>There are many tools our web development predecessors laid the groundwork in the development of accessible web pages. Accessibility is great practice, an important one. Not everyone can see the same colors, some text may need to be adjusted to the user’s preference. All the examples I have listed should be the package deal. go above and beyond. Websites should be available for all to utilize and enjoy.</p>
