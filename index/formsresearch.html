                    <p>Forms are the only way to send data back to the server from a client. If there is a need to collect data from a user, writing an HTML form is the way. We can look at forms as a tool for a user to interact with a web page or application. You most often see forms coded in languages such as PHP, JAVA, and HTML.</p>
                    <p>Web forms ordinarily contain text boxes, texts areas, check boxes, dropdown lists, buttons, radio buttons, and hidden fields.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is important to communicate logical and proper questions when writing forms, because a form is in most cases the pathway that allows users to communicate with the author, business, or what have you.</p>
                    <p>“Online forms are too important for any business website owner to ignore. They provide a means for potential customers to join your email list, ask about your products in a specific and personalized way, and give personal details useful to your business. Online forms allow users to buy your products remotely by filling their details and even making on-site payment. A website for a business without any web forms would be limited in terms of what it offers to potential customers. It would lack the mechanisms needed in today’s e-commerce.”

                       </p>
                    <p>Having forms playing such a vital role on a webpage, it is important to implement good design. It is important when writing forms to keep it simple. You do not want to ask for too much information and make it easy for a user to follow. Make sure what you are asking is straightforward. The purpose of a form is to be clear. Radio buttons should be used when giving 2 or 3 choices to a user, a dropdown button should be used when listing 4 or more choices.  Short answers should require a single-line text box and longer answers would need a multi-line text box. There should be more than enough room for a user to type their answer. These are the basics.</p>
