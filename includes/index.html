        <p>Hello!<br><br> I have always had a knack for solving problems and learning new things on computers. I would spend alot of my free time doing just that. It never really occurred to me that I should pursue a career in development, I have always leaned towards working with my hands and being creative. I am an artist, there is no denying that. 
            While digging deeper into learning about web development I have found I can use my creativity almost endlessly, and I really enjoy that aspect. Design and creativity comes naturally. Although, there is a very technical side to development that requires a great deal of knowledge and understanding. This is the side of development that really interests me and 
            I seek to understand what is going on behind the scenes. Mainly because, there is nothing more frustrating than running into a problem that could be solved just through a better understanding! Sometimes what seems to be simple is not, and what seems complicated is maybe not so much. I am excited to keep learning about web development!<br><br>-Matthieu
